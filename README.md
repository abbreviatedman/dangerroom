# dangerroom

A modified version of the amazing wedisagree [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme.

I've:

1. moved the directory listing to the right prompt;
2. replaced it with the yellow X symbol;
3. and removed the time.

The rest of the theme -- including the helpful comments --
are courtesy of the original author.

Please note that some terminal emulator-font combinations  
display the X symbol at half height. You may consider  
trying a different font for full dangerroom satisfaction.  

Enjoy!
