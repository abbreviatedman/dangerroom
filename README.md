# dangerroom

A modified version of the amazing wedisagree [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)oh-my-zsh theme.

I've:

1. moved the directory listing to the right prompt;
2. replaced it with the yellow X symbol;
3. and removed the time.

The rest of the theme -- including the helpful comments --
are courtesy of the original author.

Enjoy!
