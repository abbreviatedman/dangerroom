# dangerroom

A reconfigured version of the amazing wedisagree [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh] theme.

---

### Installation

1. Install [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh], if you don't have it. They have excellent  
directions for how to do so, and you'll never look back.
2. Take the dangerroom.zsh-theme file from this repo and put it in your  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes` directory.
3. Edit the .zshrc file in your home directory to set the `ZSH_THEME` variable  
to the value "dangerroom" (WITH the quotes!).
4. Run the command `source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal.
5. Enjoy your new theme!

### Things I love and kept about wedisagree:

#### 1. It's got great colors.  
  They're bright without being too bright, and nicely distinct from each other.

#### 2. It gives me the directory without taking up too much space.  
  Some themes seem to think I need a complete path to my current directory. No  
  thanks! I'd rather have the extra space!

#### 3. Best of all, wedisagree packs in a CRAZY amount of git info.  
  Meaningful and semantic icons and colors. Love the umbrella!


### Things I changed:

#### 1. I moved the directory listing to the right prompt.  
  Most important change. This makes everything line up on the left, making your  
  recent prompt history more easily scannable.

#### 2. I removed the time.  
  I have clocks everywhere. I don't need another in my terminal.

#### 3. I added the yellow X symbol.  
  May the danger room train you to use your powers effectively.

Please note that some terminal/font combinations display the X symbol at half  
height. Consider trying a different font for full dangerroom satisfaction.

Enjoy!
