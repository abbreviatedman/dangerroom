# dangerroom

An [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh] theme that's informative, minimal, and, above all, X-Men themed.

---

### Installation

1. Install [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh], if you don't have it. They have excellent  
directions for how to do so, and you'll never look back.

2. Take the dangerroom.zsh-theme file from this repo and put it in your  
`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes` directory.

3. Edit the .zshrc file in your home directory to set the ZSH_THEME variable to the value "dangerroom", like so:
`ZSH_THEME="dangerroom"`

4. Run the command `source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal.

5. Train your skills in the danger room.

Please note that some terminal/font combinations display the X symbol at half  
height. Consider trying a different font for full dangerroom satisfaction.

Enjoy!
