# dangerroom

A modified version of the amazing wedisagree [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme.

Things I love and kept about wedisagree:

1. It's got great colors.  
  They're bright without being too bright, and nicely distinct  
  from each other.

2. It gives me the directory without taking up too much space.  
  I don't ever feel I need a complete path.

3. Best of all, wedisagree packs in a CRAZY amount of git info.  
  Love the umbrella!


Things I changed:

1. I moved the directory listing to the right prompt.  
  Most important change. This makes everything line up on the  
  left, making your recent prompt history more easily scannable.

2. I removed the time.  
  I have clocks everywhere. I don't need another in my terminal.

3. I added the yellow X symbol.  
  May the danger room train you to use your powers effectively.

Please note that some terminal/font combinations display the X  
symbol at half height. You may consider trying a different font  
for full dangerroom satisfaction.

Enjoy!
